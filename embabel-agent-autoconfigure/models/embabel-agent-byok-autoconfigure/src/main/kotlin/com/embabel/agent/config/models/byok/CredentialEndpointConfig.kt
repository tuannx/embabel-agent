/**
 * Makes per-user keys work with nothing on the classpath but `embabel-agent-starter-byok`: one
 * [CredentialLlmServiceFactory] per wire protocol, each turning an endpoint of that protocol into
 * a client for the user's own key.
 *
 * Where a key is sent is decided before that, and an application can decide it: each factory asks
 * the registered [CredentialEndpointResolver] beans first and falls back to what this module knows
 * about the provider. So adding a provider - or overriding a shipped one's base URL - is a resolver
 * returning a value, with nothing from `com.embabel.agent.spi` in it, because a gateway speaking
 * the OpenAI protocol needs no client this module does not already have.
 *
 * That is one bean per provider *module*, not per provider: `embabel-agent-openai` speaks to five
 * providers over one wire protocol, so the coverage is Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Gemini
 * and Atlas Cloud - the whole BYOK surface. A deployment using any of them writes nothing at all.
 *
 * Without these, a [com.embabel.common.ai.model.RoleResolution.Credential] fails with
 * `NoSuitableModelException` until the application registers a factory of its own - and that
 * factory is a call to the provider module's own factory, already on the classpath. Every
 * application that has needed one has written the same `when` over provider names, each copy a
 * place to get a provider name's casing wrong or fall behind a factory signature change, and each
 * failing at runtime rather than at compile time.
 *
 * These delegate to the provider modules, not to their autoconfigurations. That is the distinction
 * that makes shipping them possible at all: a pure BYOK deployment deliberately has no provider
 * autoconfiguration - `embabel-agent-starter-byok` bans it - but it does have the factories.
 *
 * Nothing here caches. [com.embabel.common.ai.model.ConfigurableModelProvider] already caches what
 * a factory returns per (provider, key, model) behind a bounded LRU, so a cache here would be a
 * second, unbounded one holding a service per key the deployment has ever seen.
