 * Thrown when some chunks could not be embedded, even after retrying their batch in smaller pieces.
 *
 * By the time this is thrown, the chunks that did embed have been persisted with their vectors,
 * and the chunks named in [missingChunkIds] have been persisted without one: they match text
 * search but never a vector search.
 *
 * The document is stored and committed, so a refresh policy that skips existing documents, such as
 * [com.embabel.agent.rag.ingestion.policy.NeverRefreshExistingDocumentContentPolicy], will not
 * retry it on the next ingest. To complete it, pass [missingChunkIds] to
 * [AbstractChunkingContentElementRepository.reembedChunks], which embeds those chunks again and
 * replaces each stored copy. Or delete the root with
 * [ChunkingContentElementRepository.deleteRootAndDescendants] and ingest it again.
 *
 * @property missingChunkIds ids of the chunks stored without an embedding
 * @property embeddedCount number of chunks that were embedded
