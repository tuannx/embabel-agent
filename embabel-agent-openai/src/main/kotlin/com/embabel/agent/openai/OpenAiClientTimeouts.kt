/**
 * How long an OpenAI-compatible client waits to connect, and then for a response.
 *
 * [read] bounds the whole call, from sending the request to reading the last byte of the
 * response, rather than the gap between two reads. A model that sends nothing until it has
 * finished - an embedding batch, a non-streamed completion - is therefore bounded by it.
 *
 * A null [read] changes nothing. Chat completion and embedding calls then keep Spring AI's own
 * per-call timeout of 60 seconds, which it sends with every such call. Responses API models, and
 * any call made without Spring AI's options, keep the client's 10 minutes. A configured [read]
 * replaces both.
 *
 * The openai-java SDK retries a call that times out, twice by default, so a caller sees the
 * failure only after three attempts: up to three times the timeout, plus a short backoff.
