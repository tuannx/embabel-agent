/**
 * A decision service for tests that returns scripted outcomes and records each call.
 *
 * Outcomes for `ask`, `rate` and question `assess` calls are scripted by question name, and
 * outcomes for `assess` calls with a [PropositionRequest] by proposition text. `classify` returns
 * the choice scripted for the request's question name, and otherwise the classification scripted
 * for its set of category ids. A call with no scripted outcome throws [IllegalStateException].
 *
 * By default the stub answers a whole request in one question-set call. Question-set answers pass through the
 * same question validation as provider answers, so a scripted choice outside its question's
 * options, or rating evidence outside its levels, throws [IllegalStateException] from `ask`. A stub
 * built after [Builder.perQuestion] answers each question on its own: a choice question through
 * `classify`, and the other kinds through their per-question hooks.
 * The stub accepts every question kind unless other capabilities are set.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val stub = StubDecisionService.builder("triage-stub")
 *     .proposition("is_urgent", PropositionResult.Answered(true, provenance))
 *     .build()
 * ```
