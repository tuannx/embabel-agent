/**
 * A caller-owned value read out of a decision response, kept together with the response it came
 * from. Build one with one of the [of] overloads, which read the response's answered values and
 * convert them to the target type with Jackson. The default mapper fails when a constructor
 * parameter of the target has no answered value, so a record component with no matching question is
 * an error. A mapper passed in keeps its own settings.
 *
 * For a spec with an `is_urgent` proposition and a `department` choice, a record whose component
 * names match the question names receives the answers:
 *
 * ```java
 * record SupportRoute(boolean is_urgent, String department) {}
 *
 * var route = DecisionProjection.of(response, SupportRoute.class).getValue();
 * // SupportRoute[is_urgent=true, department=billing]
 * ```
 *
 * @param T the caller's target type
 * @property value the projected value
 * @property response the response the value was read from, unchanged
