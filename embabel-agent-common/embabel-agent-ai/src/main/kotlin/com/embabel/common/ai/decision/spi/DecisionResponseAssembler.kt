/**
 * Turns the answers a provider returned for a whole spec into a [DecisionResponse]. A provider
 * reports each answer it read under the question name it mapped the answer to, and [build]
 * applies the answer rules.
 *
 * - After [unsafe], every question fails and the response's request failure is
 *   [FailureReason.INVALID_RESPONSE].
 * - A name received twice through any method fails the request the same way. A repeated name
 *   means the provider's answers cannot be matched to questions safely.
 * - A name the spec does not hold is ignored and counted in the WARN line. Its siblings are kept.
 * - A question with no answer, an answer of the wrong kind, an unreadable answer, or an outcome
 *   the question's `validate` rejects fails only that question with [FailureReason.INVALID_RESPONSE].
 * - The response lists the answers in spec order, whatever order they arrived in.
 *
 * Outcomes pass through unchanged, so any confidence or evidence in them is what the provider reported.
 *
 * When any anomaly occurs, [build] logs one WARN naming the service, each affected spec question
 * with its [Anomaly], and the unexpected count. Logged question names come from the spec. Received
 * keys, ids and outcomes never appear in a log line or exception message, because a provider can
 * be steered to echo its input there.
 *
 * An assembler builds one response. It is not safe for use from several threads at once.
