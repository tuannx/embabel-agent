/**
 * Opt-in observations for decision services, preserving the delegate's DECISION metadata snapshot.
 * Classification emits one `embabel.ai.classification` observation; proposition assessment emits one
 * `embabel.ai.decision` observation. Both carry only fixed `operation` and `outcome` tags. False is an
 * `answered` outcome, just like true. Operational failures and exceptions use a fixed, stackless
 * error marker with no cause. Original exceptions are rethrown unchanged and never logged.
 * Thread interruption state is untouched. Non-fatal observation lifecycle exceptions use bounded
 * diagnostics when logging is available and never replace service behavior. JVM error types propagate.
 *
 * An ask emits one logical `embabel.ai.ask` observation plus one `embabel.ai.decision` observation
 * per provider call made inside it: `ask_question_set` for a question-set call, and `assess` or `rate` for each
 * proposition or rating question asked on its own. A choice question asked on its own goes through
 * `classify` and emits one `embabel.ai.classification` observation. The capabilities are the delegate's. Preflight checks them
 * against the hook interfaces of the delegate, so a delegate whose capabilities claim a hook it does
 * not implement fails with an [IllegalStateException] before any provider call. Every ask overload
 * runs through the shared execution path, so a delegate's own `ask` override is not called.
