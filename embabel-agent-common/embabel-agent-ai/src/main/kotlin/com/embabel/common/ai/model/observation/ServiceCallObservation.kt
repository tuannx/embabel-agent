 * Shared call lifecycle for the service decorators, without retaining requests or results in telemetry.
 *
 * Provider calls emit `embabel.ai.classification` or `embabel.ai.decision` with the tag keys `operation`
 * and `outcome` for every operation, so all meters under one name share one key set. A logical ask emits
 * `embabel.ai.ask` with the keys `operation`, `outcome`, `service`, `provider` and `question_count`,
 * all set on every ask. Every tag value comes from a fixed label set except `service`
 * and `provider`. `service` is the answering service's own name and `provider` its provider. Both are
 * bounded by configuration, so a service must not take its name from request or user data.
