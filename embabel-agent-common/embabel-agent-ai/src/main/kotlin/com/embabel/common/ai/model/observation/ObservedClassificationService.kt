/**
 * Opt-in observations for classification, with the delegate's metadata and model family preserved.
 * Each call emits `embabel.ai.classification` with fixed `operation` and `outcome` tags and validates
 * the selected category against the request. Provider observations inherit the open call scope.
 * Payloads, model identifiers and raw exceptions are never added to these observations or debug logs.
 * Operational failures and thrown exceptions record a fixed, stackless error marker with no cause.
 * The original exception is rethrown unchanged; the wrapper never changes thread interruption state.
 * Non-fatal observation lifecycle exceptions use bounded diagnostics when logging is available and
 * never replace service behavior. JVM error types propagate.
