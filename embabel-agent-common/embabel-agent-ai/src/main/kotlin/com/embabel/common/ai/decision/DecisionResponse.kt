/**
 * The answer to one question in a decision response. There is one implementation per question
 * kind and no other implementation can exist, so a Kotlin `when` or a Java `switch` over an
 * answer covers every case.
 *
 * An answer can be read without the question that produced it. It holds the question's name and
 * kind, the public options or levels, and the typed outcome. It never holds the question's
 * instructions or the decision input. An answer read from JSON holds its options or levels as
 * written. The typed lookup on a response compares them with a question.
 *
 * ```java
 * String route = switch (response.answer("department")) {
 *     case DecisionAnswer.Choice choice
 *         when choice.getOutcome() instanceof ClassificationResult.Selected selected -> selected.getCategoryId();
 *     case DecisionAnswer.Choice choice -> "triage-queue";
 *     case DecisionAnswer.Proposition proposition -> "not a choice";
 *     case DecisionAnswer.Rating rating -> "not a choice";
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * In JSON an answer is an object whose `kind` member names its class. It has the same form inside
 * a response and on its own.
