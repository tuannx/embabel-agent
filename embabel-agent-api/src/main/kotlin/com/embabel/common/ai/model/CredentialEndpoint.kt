/**
 * Where a user's key should be sent, and what the service built from it should say about itself.
 *
 * A value rather than a service: the application states which endpoint speaks for a provider, and
 * the platform builds the client, so nothing here names a type from `com.embabel.agent.spi`. That
 * is the point - [CredentialLlmServiceFactory] is the other way round, and requires a package the
 * documentation asks application code not to depend on.
 *
 * The case is the wire protocol, because that is what decides which client can talk to the
 * endpoint. Everything that varies within a protocol is a field.
 *
 * Adding a provider therefore does not mean adding a case, and cannot: the interface is sealed, so
 * only this module can. Nearly every provider speaks one of the protocols below, and reaching it is
 * a [CredentialEndpointResolver] returning [OpenAiCompatible] or [Anthropic] with your base URL -
 * no framework change, no new type.
 *
 * A case earns its place only when a protocol needs a *client* this framework does not have, and
 * whoever adds one has to add that client too. Sealed so that the two stay together: an open
 * hierarchy would let an application define a case nothing here can build, and it would fail at
 * runtime with a key already in hand. Until such a protocol is shipped, reach it by registering a
 * [CredentialLlmServiceFactory] and building the service yourself, accepting the SPI dependency
 * that carries.

/**
 * Says where a user's key should be sent, for the providers this application knows about.
 *
 * Application API, not SPI: you implement it and register it as a bean, and the platform calls it.
 * The extension point for BYOK against a provider the framework does not ship. Register as many as
 * you like: the first non-null answer wins, in [org.springframework.core.Ordered] order, so a
 * resolver answers for the providers it knows and returns null for the rest. What reads them is
 * the `embabel-agent-starter-byok` machinery that builds services from user keys, so a deployment
 * without that starter can register these and never be asked.
 *
 * What these beans say is the first word, and the endpoints `embabel-agent-starter-byok` knows for
 * Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Gemini and Atlas Cloud are the last: answering for one of
 * those overrides it, for a proxy or a custom base URL, with no `@Order` needed. The shipped
 * endpoints are not beans, so they cannot tie with yours - `@Order` decides only which of *your*
 * resolvers is asked first, and ties between them fall back to bean registration order.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @Bean
 * fun ourGatewayEndpoint() = CredentialEndpointResolver { credential, _ ->
 *     if (!credential.provider.equals("OurGateway", ignoreCase = true)) null
 *     else CredentialEndpoint.OpenAiCompatible(provider = "OurGateway", baseUrl = GATEWAY_URL)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Return null rather than an endpoint for a provider you do not handle: a resolver that answers for
 * everything would point someone else's key at your gateway.
 *
 * The platform caches the service it builds, per (provider, key, model), so a resolver is consulted
 * on a cache miss rather than on every call - though possibly more than once within one, as each
 * wire protocol's builder gets its turn. Implementations must be thread-safe, and should be pure
 * and cheap for the same reason.
 *
 * That cache is keyed on (provider, key, model) and not on what you return here, so a resolver that
 * answers differently for the same three - per tenant, say, read from some ambient context - will
 * have its first answer serve every later caller sharing them.
