/**
 * B3: the retry listener in [RetryProperties] reports the state of the loop, not the decision
 * the policy took. `onError` fires after the throwable is registered but before `canRetry` is
 * consulted, and `close` fires on every failing exit, not only on exhaustion. So the operator
 * reads "Retry attempt 1 of unknown" followed by "Maximum attempts of 10 have been reached" on a run
 * that made a single attempt, and raises `max-attempts` for nothing.
 *
 * These tests pin what the messages must claim, by comparing them to what the loop actually did.
