 * The three core.retry providers (deepseek, mistral-ai, google-genai) used to run silently: their
 * template carried a policy and no listener, so a rate limit, a give-up and an exhaustion all
 * passed unlogged. These tests hold the core.retry path to the same account as the spring-retry
 * one in [RetryPropertiesLoggingTest]: announce a retry only when one follows, name the configured
 * ceiling, and claim exhaustion only when the attempts really ran out.
