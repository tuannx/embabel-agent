/**
 * Chooses skills by SEMANTIC SIMILARITY, for callers that want to inject a skill's

 *
 * The existing activation path ([Skills.asIndividualReferences]) is a decision the LLM
 * makes: it reads skill descriptions, picks one, calls it, then reads the body. That
 * costs a turn and a judgement — and the judgement is exactly what a small model gets
 * wrong, because a model confident in a wrong answer never reaches for help. Selecting
 * by embedding removes the decision: the skill whose description matches the query
 * arrives already open, at the cost of one embedding call and no LLM work.
 *
 * OPT-IN AND ADDITIVE. Nothing selects this way unless a caller constructs this class,
 * and only skills that ASK for it ([activatesByEmbedding]) are eligible, so an existing
 * skill library behaves exactly as before.
 *
 * Similarity discriminates by SUBJECT, not by difficulty: it can tell a contract question
 * from a financial one, but not a hard question from an easy one. A skill selected this
 * way must therefore be safe to inject on every question in its subject area, since that
 * is what will happen.
